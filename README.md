# Digital Control Systems

This repository contains projects and code implementations from the "Digital Control Systems" course, which focused on principles and techniques related to digital control systems. Here are the key highlights:

1. **Linearization and Continuous Control:**
   - Proficiently managed the linearization of nonlinear systems.
   - Designed precise Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers for continuous control applications.
   - Demonstrated expertise in controlling continuous-time systems.

2. **Discrete Control and Digital Design:**
   - Expertly handled system discretization for digital control applications.
   - Developed PID controllers and Dead Beat controllers in discrete-time control systems.
   - Applied digital control techniques for improved system performance.

3. **State Space and Observer Design:**
   - Applied advanced techniques for state space control system design.
   - Effectively designed observers using MATLAB and Simulink for accurate system state estimation.
   - Utilized state space representation to analyze and control dynamic systems.

These projects and assignments provided practical experience in digital control systems, including both continuous and discrete-time control, linearization, PID control, and state space design.
